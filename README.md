## Description
This repository contains an implementation of a Symbolic Regression algorithm, using a tree-based **Genetic Programming** (GP) evolutionary technique. The algorithm evolves mathematical expressions in order to find the model that best fits a given set of data in the form $(X, y)$. By leveraging *selection*, according to a fitness measure, *mutation* and *crossover*, the SR algorithm generates mathematical formulas that are able to capture the complex patterns present in the input data.

## Key Features
- **Island Model Genetic Algorithm**
  - The population is divided into a certain number of **subpopulations** (a.k.a. *islands*) which evolve separately and can probablisticly ,occasionaly exchange individuals (a.k.a *migration*) in order to avoid local optima and rapid convergence;
  - At each migration event, according to a migration rate parameter, one or more individuals migrate from the source island to another random island, as a way to ensure equal chance of genetic mixing across islands.
- **Tree-Based Representation**
  - The evolutionary algorithm iteratively evolves a population of mathematical formulas, represented as full and grow trees;
  - Internal nodes are randomly chosen from function set (arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential operators), while leaves are randomly chosen from terminal set (constants and variables).
  - Each tree (individual population) is valid for all variables of the set. When calculating the MSE no invalid mathimatical operation is present 
- **Elitism**
  - To preserve high-quality solutions, the best individuals (a.k.a. *elites*) are directly inserted into the next generation, without being subjected to any change.
- **Parents Selection**
  - Different parents selection strategies are implemented. Fitness-proportional, rank based and tournament selection.
- **Mutation and Crossover**
  - Various mutation mechanisms are implemented. Replaced a subtree with a new one (`mutate_subtree`) or modify a single node (`mutate_single_node`) in the selected parent tree;
  - Combine two different trees for generating new offsprings. This allows the algorithm to explore new regions in the search space, encouraging exploration instead of exploitation.
- **Other Strategies**
  - Probabilistic collapsing, collapsing produces equivalent formulas to the one in the beggining , just prunes branches and reduces depth.
  - Take over detection is applied for when an individual takes over most of the population, the population is trimmed and subsituted with new individuals.   

## How it works
- **Initialization**
  - A population of individuals (*trees*) is initialized on each island. Depending on the value assigned to the variable `grow_full_ratio`, each island's population is initialized with a number of full trees and grow trees;
  - In each of the `ISLAND_NUM` islands, there are `ISLAND_POPULATION` individuals.
- **Selection**
  - Parents are selected based on their fitness (in which measure the mathematical formula represented by the tree fits well the data provided as input), using various strategies (*e.g.* rank-based selection).
- **Reproduction**
  - Offsprings are generated through mutation and crossover genetic operators.
- **Evolution**
  - Over the course of generations, populations on the islands evolve and only the best performing trees survive.
- **Convergence**
  - The evolutionary process continues for a certain number of generations (`MAX_GENERATIONS`).

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `sym_reg.ipynb`
  - The Jupyter notebook through which it is possible to experiment with Symbolic Regression using Genetic Programming. Thank to parent selection, mutation and crossover genetic operators, it is possible to find a mathematical formula that well fit the given dataset.
  ```python
  x[0] + np.sin(x[1]) / 5   # a simple mathematical formula for problem 0
  ```
- `tree.py`
  - The .py file that contains the **Tree** class, the main component of the project. This class provides methods for generating grow and full trees, methods for computing the fitness and methods for mutation and crossover.
- `data/`
  - A folder that contains eight different input problems (*npz* files). Each problem is represented by a dataset that can be used to train and test the model.
- `pyproject.toml`
  - The configuration file containing dependencies and metadata for the project. *Poetry* is used for package management.
